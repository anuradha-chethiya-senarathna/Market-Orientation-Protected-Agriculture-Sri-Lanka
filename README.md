# Market-Orientation-Protected-Agriculture-Sri-Lanka

Study on market orientation of Sri Lankan vegetable farmers in protected and open-field farming (2025).

## Overview
This repository contains the undergraduate research by Meegahakumbure Gedara Kuruppu Mudiyanselage Anurada Chethiya Senarathna, submitted to the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. The study assesses the market orientation (MO) of vegetable farmers in Welimada and Bandarawela under the Smallholder Agribusiness Partnership Program (SAPP), comparing fully funded and partially funded farmers in Protected Agriculture Farming (PAF) and Open-Field Farming (OFF).

## Key Findings
- Partially funded farmers show higher MO in both PAF (p < 0.0000) and OFF (p = 0.0059).
- Partial funding enhances market responsiveness, especially in PAF.
- Recommendations: Adopt cost-sharing models, provide MO training.

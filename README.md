# Market Orientation in Protected Agriculture in Sri Lanka

## Overview
This repository hosts a project exploring market orientation strategies for protected agriculture in Sri Lanka. Protected agriculture, such as greenhouses and poly-tunnels, enables farmers to produce high-quality crops despite climate challenges. This project analyzes market trends, consumer preferences, and crop profitability to help farmers make data-driven decisions, enhancing economic resilience and sustainability.

## Motivation
Sri Lankaâ€™s agriculture sector supports 70% of its rural population and employs nearly 30% of the workforce. Protected agriculture is increasingly vital due to climate variability and demand for high-value crops. This project aims to bridge the gap between production and market needs, addressing challenges like high input costs and forex shortages by identifying profitable crops and market opportunities.

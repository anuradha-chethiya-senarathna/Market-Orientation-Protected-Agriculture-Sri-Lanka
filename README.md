# 🥬 Market Orientation in Protected Agriculture in Sri Lanka

## 🌍 About the Project
This repository is part of a 2025 research initiative that explores **market orientation practices among Sri Lankan vegetable farmers**, with a focus on both **protected agriculture** (e.g., greenhouses, poly-tunnels) and traditional open-field farming. The study aims to provide actionable insights for improving farmer income, resource allocation, and long-term agricultural sustainability in the region.

Protected agriculture enables the production of high-quality vegetables year-round while reducing the risk from climate variability, pests, and market shocks. However, success depends on aligning production with market demand — the core focus of this project.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Understand market dynamics affecting vegetable farmers using protected agriculture.
- Identify which crops are most profitable and in-demand in various market zones.
- Compare practices and outcomes between protected and open-field farming.
- Develop visual tools and dashboards for decision-making.
- Provide a policy framework to support smallholder adoption of market-oriented strategies.

🔍 Methodology Summary
The study combines quantitative surveys with market data analysis. Farmers were interviewed using structured questionnaires to assess their:

Market access and pricing knowledge

Production choices based on demand

Adoption of protected cultivation techniques

Challenges faced in the supply chain

Additional data was collected from market bulletins, price reports, and crop calendars to triangulate findings and validate farmer perceptions.

# 🥬 Market Orientation in Protected Agriculture in Sri Lanka

## 🌍 About the Project
This repository is part of a 2025 research initiative that explores **market orientation practices among Sri Lankan vegetable farmers**, with a focus on both **protected agriculture** (e.g., greenhouses, poly-tunnels) and traditional open-field farming. The study aims to provide actionable insights for improving farmer income, resource allocation, and long-term agricultural sustainability in the region.

Protected agriculture enables the production of high-quality vegetables year-round while reducing the risk from climate variability, pests, and market shocks. However, success depends on aligning production with market demand — the core focus of this project.
